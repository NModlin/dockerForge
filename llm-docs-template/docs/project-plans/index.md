# Project Plans

This section contains documentation for current and upcoming development projects. Project plans outline the goals, implementation details, and timelines for feature development and improvements.

<!-- 
@llm-instructions
DOCUMENT PURPOSE: Provide an overview of project plans and roadmap
PRIMARY AUDIENCE: Project stakeholders, developers, and users interested in future development
MAINTENANCE PRIORITY: High (reflects current development status)

MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES:
- Keep the project lists up-to-date with their current status
- Move projects between sections as their status changes
- Maintain consistent table formatting for each project section
- Include start/completion dates when available
- Add new projects to the appropriate section based on status
-->

## Active Projects

<!-- @llm-update-section
This section contains active projects that are currently being worked on.
- Keep the table sorted by priority (highest first)
- Move completed projects to the Completed Projects section
- Move on-hold projects to the Planned Projects section with a note
- Update progress indicators as development continues
- When adding new active projects, include all required fields
-->

| Project | Status | Started | Target Completion | Progress | Description |
|---------|--------|---------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Example Project | Active | 2025-03-01 | 2025-04-15 | 25% | Example project description. This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes. |

## Planned Projects

<!-- @llm-update-section
This section contains projects that are planned but not yet started.
- Keep the table sorted by priority (highest first)
- Move projects to Active Projects when work begins
- Include as much information as is currently available
- Update estimated start dates as planning progresses
-->

| Project | Status | Planned Start | Target Completion | Description |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Future Example | Planning | 2025-05-01 | 2025-06-30 | Another example project for future development. This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes. |

## Completed Projects

<!-- @llm-update-section
This section contains projects that have been completed.
- Keep the table sorted by completion date (most recent first)
- Include actual completion dates
- Add brief outcome summary
- Include links to relevant documentation about the completed feature

| Project | Completion Date | Description | Outcome |
|---------|----------------|-------------|---------|

## Project Creation

To create a new project plan, use the [project template](future-projects/template.md). This template provides a standardized structure for documenting project requirements, implementation details, and timelines.

## Project Lifecycle

Projects in this documentation follow a standard lifecycle:

1. **Planning**: Initial project proposal and planning
2. **Active**: Project is actively being worked on
3. **Completed**: Project has been completed and released
4. **On Hold**: Project development has been temporarily paused

Projects may also be **Cancelled** if they are no longer being pursued. Cancelled projects should remain in the documentation with an explanation of the cancellation.

<!-- @llm-reasoning-guide
When updating project status:
1. First determine the new status of the project (Planning, Active, Completed, On Hold, Cancelled)
2. Move the project entry to the appropriate section
3. Update all relevant fields (dates, progress, description)
4. If a project is marked Completed, add an outcome summary
5. If a project is marked On Hold or Cancelled, add an explanation
6. Ensure consistent formatting is maintained
7. Update any related documentation that may reference the project
