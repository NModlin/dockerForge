     - Conduct comprehensive penetration testing
     - Run vulnerability scanning
     - Perform cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
     - Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
     - Check for CSRF vulnerabilities
     - Verify proper TLS implementation
     - Test session security

   - Integration Testing:
     - End-to-end security workflow testing
     - Verify all security components work together
     - Test system under high load
     - Check for performance impacts of security features
     - Verify backwards compatibility where appropriate

Implement proper validation, error handling, and follow security best practices. Conduct thorough testing across different devices and browsers to ensure a consistent security experience.

## Next Steps

To begin implementing this security upgrade, ask your AI coding assistant to "Implement Phase 1 of the Security upgrade project plan" to start with the enhanced user management system.

Each phase builds upon previous phases, so they should be implemented sequentially. The AI coding assistant should be able to use the detailed implementation prompts to guide the development process for each phase.

After each phase is completed, you should thoroughly test the implementation according to the testing requirements before proceeding to the next phase.
