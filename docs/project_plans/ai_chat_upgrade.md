# AI Chat Interface Upgrade (AI_upgrade2) Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project plan outlines the phased implementation of an AI chat interface as a permanent right sidebar in the DockerForge Web UI. The chat interface will provide context-aware assistance, enabling users to interact with the system more efficiently, especially when resolving container issues or security vulnerabilities.

Each phase is designed to be implemented independently, allowing for incremental development and testing. This modular approach enables starting a specific phase (e.g., "AI upgrade phase 2") as a separate task.

## Phases of Implementation
