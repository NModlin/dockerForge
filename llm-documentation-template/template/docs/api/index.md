# API Reference

This section contains comprehensive documentation for the project's API, allowing developers to programmatically interact with the system.

## API Overview

The API is a RESTful HTTP API that provides access to the project's functionality. The API uses JSON for request and response bodies.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. See the [Authentication](#authentication) section below for details.

## API Endpoints

### Core API

- [Example Endpoint](example-endpoint.md) - Example API endpoint documentation

## API Version History

| Version | Release Date | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1.0     | 2025-03-18   | Initial API release |

## Authentication

API requests use Bearer token authentication. To authenticate your requests, include an `Authorization` header with a valid token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Obtaining a Token

Tokens can be obtained by making a POST request to the `/auth/token` endpoint with valid credentials.

## Status Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | OK - The request was successful |
| 201 | Created - Resource was successfully created |
| 400 | Bad Request - The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Authentication failed or user lacks required permissions |
| 403 | Forbidden - Authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn't have access |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource could not be found |
| 409 | Conflict - Request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - An unexpected error occurred on the server |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to prevent abuse. Rate limit information is included in the response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1616201820
```

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

@llm-instructions
This is the index file for API documentation.
- Update the API Endpoints section when new API endpoint documentation is added
- Keep the API Version History table up-to-date with each release
- Maintain the Status Codes table with any new status codes
- Update Authentication section when auth methods change
- Update Rate Limiting information if rate limiting policies change

DOCUMENT PURPOSE: Provide an overview of the API and entry point to API documentation
PRIMARY AUDIENCE: Developers integrating with the API
MAINTENANCE PRIORITY: High (key reference document)
