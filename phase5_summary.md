## Configuration

The Docker Compose management system is configured in the DockerForge configuration file:

```yaml
docker:
  # Docker Compose settings
  compose:
    file_path: ""
    project_name: ""
    discovery:
      enabled: true
      recursive: true
      include_common_locations: true
      search_paths:
        - "."
        - "~/docker"
        - "~/projects"
      exclude_patterns:
        - "**/node_modules/**"
        - "**/.git/**"
    
    parser:
      schema_dir: ~/.dockerforge/schemas/compose
      expand_env_vars: true
      validate: true
    
    change_management:
      backup_dir: ~/.dockerforge/backups/compose
      auto_backup: true
      max_backups: 10
      atomic_updates: true
    
    templates:
      directory: ~/.dockerforge/templates/compose
      auto_load: true
      variable_pattern: "{{variable}}"
